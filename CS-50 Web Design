Routing decisions are made to determine how data is transferred from one point to another in a network. Routers make decisions based on routing tables, which contain information about the best path for data to take.
Packets of data are sent from one router to another, and multiple paths can be used to ensure data flow in case of congestion. This is known as multi-path routing. Packets are structured and standardized, with the source and destination held within each packet.
TCP/IP are two protocols that allow computers to transfer data between them over the internet. IP or internet protocol is a way by which computers can identify one another across the internet. Every computer has a unique address in the world, known as an IP address. IP addresses are in the form of #.#.#.#, with numbers ranging from 0 to 255. IP addresses are 32-bits, meaning that these addresses could accommodate over 4 billion addresses. Newer versions of IP addresses, implementing 128-bits, can accommodate far more computers!
In the real world, servers do a lot of work for us. They host websites, store data, and provide resources to clients.
TCP, or transmission control protocol, is used to distinguish web services from one another. For example, 80 is used to denote HTTP and 443 is used to denote HTTPS. These numbers are port numbers. When information is sent from one location to another, a source IP address, a destination IP address, and TCP port number are sent.
These protocols are also used to fragment large files into multiple parts or packets. For example, a large photo of a cat can be sent in multiple packets. When a packet is lost, TCP/IP can request missing packets again from the origin server. TCP will acknowledge when all the data has been transmitted and received.
DNS, or domain name systems, is a collection of servers on the internet that are used to route website addresses like harvard.edu to a specific IP address. DNS simply hold a table or database that links specific, fully qualified domain names to specific IP addresses.
HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol is an application-level protocol that developers use to build powerful and useful things through the transferring of data from one place to another. When you see an address such as https://www.example.com you are actually implicitly visiting that address with a / at the end of it. The path is what exists after that slash. For example, https://www.example.com/folder/file.html visits example.com and browses to the folder folder and then visits the file named file.html.
The .com is called a top-level domain that is used to denote the location or type of organization associated with this address. <https:// in this address is the protocol that is used to connect to that web address. By protocol, we mean that HTTP utilizes GET or POST requests to ask for information from a server. For example, you can launch Google Chrome, right-click, and click inspect. When you open the developer tools and visit Network, selecting Preserve log, you will see Request Headers. Youâ€™ll see mentions of GET. This is possible in other browsers as well, using slightly different methods.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure and give meaning to content on the web. It is the backbone of any website, providing the structure and content that can then be styled and manipulated with CSS and JavaScript.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a webpage.
JavaScript is a programming language used for client-side scripting on the web, and can be used for both front-end and back-end development. It is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, and can be included in an HTML document using the <script> tag or linked to an external JavaScript file using the <script> tag with a src attribute.
